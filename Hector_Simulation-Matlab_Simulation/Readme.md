## Dependencies:
1. [MATLAB & Simulink 2023a + ](https://www.mathworks.com/?s_tid=gn_logo)
2. [Simulink Simscape + Simscape Multibody Library](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simscape-multibody.html)
3. [CasADi for MATLAB](https://web.casadi.org/)
4. [qpOASES](https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES) (included in CasADi)

## System Requirements:
+ It is suggested to run this simulation on a Windows PC with Windows 10 and later;
+ Linux PC may run into problems with path definitions in Simulink (but easily fixable on the user end);

## Installation:
+ Download and unzip Hector_Simulation to your desired directory; 
+ Download and unzip [CasADi MATLAB](https://web.casadi.org/get/) to the same directory;
+ Download and install MATLAB 2023a (or later version);

## How to Run:
+ Launch MATLAB 2023a (or later version);
+ Add to path: entire simulation folder and subfolders, entire CasADi Library folder and subfolders;
+ Open and run Initiate_Simulation.m to load model and simulation parameters;
+ Open Hector_Simulation.slx and modify simulation base on your need;
+ Press Ctrl + D to build model;
+ Run model/simulation in Mechanics Explorer (note that simulation does not run in real-time);
+ User may comment/uncomment arm assembly and control in Simulink model;
